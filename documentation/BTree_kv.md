# BTree_kv

This data structure implements the well-known B-tree balanced search tree. It is an generalization of binary search tree data structures where each node, instead of holding a single key-value pair, can contain a sorted array of key-value pairs. This data structure is well suited to holding large blocks of data while allowing logarithmic search times for searches, accesses, insertions, and deletions. B-trees are often used as the fundamental data structure of databases and file systems.
