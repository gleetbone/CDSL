# Cable_utf8

This data structure is for very long character strings and has lots of utility API functions for finding and replacing substrings. The strings contain Unicode UTF8 characters. The internal data structure is a red-black tree of substrings. 

The name of this data structure implies a lot of strings wound together - all of the good names (like ropes or twines) were already taken.
