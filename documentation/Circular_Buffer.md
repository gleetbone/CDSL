# Circular_Buffer

This very simple data structure is a wraparound buffer that holds the contained 
items with FIFO access. There are no "deep" functions for dispose or wipe out: 
the items placed into the circular buffer are not themselves altered or disposed 
of by calls of functions in this class.
