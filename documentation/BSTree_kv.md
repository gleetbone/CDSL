# BSTree_kv

This data structure implements a non-self-balancing binary search tree. So it's fast to insert or remove an key-item pair, but it will become unbalanced as more and more items are inserted and deleted. When commanded to balance itself, the entire tree is re-balanced - potentially a time consuming operation for larger trees.

### Protocols Supported

- P_Basic
- P_Iterable_kv
- P_DIterable_kv
