# Tuple

This data structure has user-defined fields to hold data. Its field types are configured at run time. It is useful for holding formatted data when a custom structure definition is inappropriate or too much work. It holds all integer types, floating point types, pointers, character strings, and arrays of each of these. A potential use is to hold multiple return values from a function.
