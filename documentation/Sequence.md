# Sequence

This data structure implements a resizable array to hold the contained items. Note that the capacity of the sequence and the count of the sequence are different things. Creating a sequence with a capacity of 3 leaves the count of items at 0. Use the `ensure_count()` function to set the item count. A similar class is AList, which is a linked list implemented with an array.
