# Trie

This data structure (pronounced "tree") implements an n-ary tree structure. It is different from  key-value binary search trees in that the key is effectively a sequence of sub-keys or key elements. A common usage for a Trie is to store English words where the sequence of keys for the word is the sequence of characters in the word's spelling. In such an usage, the Trie offers quick lookup times and adapts itself memory-wise to the data it stores.
