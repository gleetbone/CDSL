# SList

This data structure implements a singly linked list. So it's fast to iterate through the list and insert or remove an item anywhere in the list, but slower to get to an item by its index since the list has to be traversed to find the item by index.

### Protocols Supported

- P_Basic
- P_Indexable
- P_Iterable
