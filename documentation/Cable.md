# Cable

This data structure is for very long character strings and has lots of utility API functions for finding and replacing substrings. The strings contain eight bit ASCII-type characters, not Unicode. The internal data structure is a red-black tree of substrings. 

The name of this data structure implies a lot of strings wound together - all of the good names (like ropes or twines) were already taken.
