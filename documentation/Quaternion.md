# Quaternion

This data structure implements quaternions. Quaternions are special 4-dimensional mathematical constructs that are a higher dimensional superset of complex numbers (not just a single imaginary part `i`, but three orthogonal "imaginary" parts `i, j, and k`). That's great all by itself, but their main use is their ability to represent three dimensional rotations of three dimensional vectors. Quaternion operations include addition, subtraction, multiplication, inversion, and rotation of a 3-vector.
